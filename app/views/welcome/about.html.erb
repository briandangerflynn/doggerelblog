  <h3>What's this site about?</h3>

    <p>When I was a kid, poems rhymed, and they were silly and fun. Then I got older, and teachers told me that those types of poems are bad. Then I got even older and kinda stopped caring.</p>

    <p>Doggerel Blog is a site dedicated to writing and sharing poems for fun, without caring whether or not other people think they're good.</p>

    <p>Whether you write badly, comedically, childishly or any variation of the three, we warmly welcome you to share your awful poetry on this site.</p>

  <h3>What's the deal with the weird name?</h3>

    <p><strong>Doggerel</strong> is poetry that is irregular in rhythm and in rhyme, often deliberately for burlesque or comic effect. The word is derived from the Middle English "dogerel,"" probably a diminutive of "dog."</p>

    <p>Appearing since ancient times in the literatures of many cultures, it is characteristic of nursery rhymes and children's song. Less warmly, it's also used derisively to mean "verse or words that are badly written or expressed."</p>
